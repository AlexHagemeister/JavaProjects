Program Description:

	This program is a demonstration of a class that holds personal data, called Person.
	It has instance variables for name, address, age, and phone number, 
	and has methods for getting and setting these values. 
	Has a print method that outputs the values of the instance variables.

	The program also includes a Driver class that creates three instances of the Person class 
	and populates their information using the Scanner class.
	 

Program specs:

	The Person class: 
		- Has instance variables for name, address, age, and phone number. 
		- It has a default constructor and an overloaded constructor that can accept input for all four variables. 
		- getter and setter methods for each instance variable 
		- a print method that outputs the values of the instance variables.
	
	The Driver class:
		- Uses the Scanner class to read input and creates three instances of the Person class. 
		- Calls the print method on each instance to output the values of their instance variables.

	
Program design:

	Variables: 
		
		Person class:
			name (String)
			address (String)
			age (int)
			phoneNo (string)
	
		Driver class:		
			name (String):
			address (String)
			age (int)
			phoneNo (string)
		
	Input: 
	
		The Driver class uses the Scanner class to read input for the name, address, age, and phone number of each Person instance.
		
	Processing: 
	
		The Driver class creates three instances of the Person class 
		and sets their values using the input from the Scanner class.
		
	Printing: 
	
		The Person class has a print method that outputs the values of the instance variables. 
		The Driver class calls this method on each of the three Person instances to print their values.
