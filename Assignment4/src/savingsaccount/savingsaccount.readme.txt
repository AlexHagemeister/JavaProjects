Savings Account: Program Design and Output  

This is a Java project that contains two classes for managing savings accounts: SavingsAccount and SpecialSavings.

SavingsAccount class (Part 1)

    The SavingsAccount class is used to store information about the savings balance and interest rates for individual accounts.  

    Variables:
        - savingsBalance: private instance variable indicating the amount the saver currently has on deposit.  

    Processing: 
        - SavingsAccount(): default constructor that initializes the savingsBalance to 0.
        - SavingsAccount(float): constructor that initializes the savingsBalance to the value passed as an argument.
        - calculateMonthlyInterest(): method to calculate the monthly interest by multiplying 
        the balance by annualInterestRate divided by 12, and adding to savingsBalance. 
        - Getters and setters for the annualInterestRate variable.
        - Getters and setters for the savingsBalance variable.
        - deposit(): method to add money to the savingsBalance.
        - withdraw(): method to subtract money from the savingsBalance.

    Printing:
        printAccountInfo(): method to print the account information.

SpecialSavings class (Part 2)

    The SpecialSavings class extends SavingsAccount and provides additional functionality to pay interest of 10% 
    on accounts that have balances that exceed 10K.

    Variables: 
        - specialRateThreshold (private float): the threshold for the interest rate to change.
        - specialInterestRate (private float): indicating the threshold for the  alt. interest rate.

    Processing:
        - SpecialSavings(): overloaded default constructor 
        - SpecialSavings(float): overloaded initialization constructor 
        - getInterestRate(): overloaded method to return the interest rate for accounts with balances that exceed threshold
        - Getters and setters for rateThreshold and overThresholdInterestRate variables.

    Printing:
        - printAccountInfo(): overloaded method to print the account information along with the over10K variable.

AccountTestDriver class (Parts 1 & 2)

    The AccountTestDriver class is used to test the SavingsAccount and SpecialSavings classes.

    Variables:
        - saver1 and saver2: SavingsAccount objects
        - saver3 and saver4: SpecialSavings objects

    Processing:
        - main(): creates the objects and tests their methods

    Printing:
        - main(): prints the results of the tests using the printAccountInfo() methods of the SavingsAccount and SpecialSavings classes.
