** Ship Inheritance: Program Design and Output **

This package contains the Ship class, and it's two subclasses, CargoShip and CruiseShip.
A ShipDriver class is also provided to test the classes by populating an mixed array of 
Ship objects, and demonstrates the polymorphic behavior of the classes.


Ship class:

    Description:
        Parent class with properties common to all ships, which will be inherited by subclasses

    Variables:
        - floating (boolean): whether the ship is floating or not
        - capacity (int): the capacity of the ship
        - length (int): the length of the ship
        - width (int): the width of the ship
        - name (String): the name of the ship
        - height (int): the height of the ship
        - origin (String): the origin of the ship
        - departureDate (String): the departure date of the ship
        - arrivalDate (String): the arrival date of the ship
        - departingPort (String): the departing port of the ship
        - arrivalPort (String): the arrival port of the ship
        - owner (String): the owner of the ship
      
    Processing: 
        - Ship(): default constructor
        - Ship(args): Initialization constructor
        - Setters and Getters for all variables
        - print(): prints the ship's information

    Printing:
        - print(): prints the ship's information using System.out.printf()

CargoShip class:

    Description:
        Subclass extends Ship with properties specific to cargo ships

    Variables:
        - cargoType (String): the type of cargo the ship is carrying
        - loadingMethod (String): the method of loading cargo
        - numberOfCranes (int): the number of cranes on the ship
        - contraband (boolean): whether the ship is carrying contraband or not
        - cargoValue (float): the value of the cargo
      
    Processing: 
        - CargoShip(): overloaded default constructor
        - CargoShip(args): overloaded initialization constructor
        - Setters and Getters for all variables
        - print(): overloaded to print the cargo ship's additional information, then calls Ship's print()

    Printing:
        - print(): overloaded to print the cargo ship's additional information, then calls Ship's print()

CruiseShip class:

    Description:
        Subclass extends Ship with properties specific to cruise ships

    Variables:
        - ticketPrice (float): the price of a ticket on the ship
        - numberOfRooms (int): the number of rooms on the ship
        - buffetMenu (String): the buffet menu on the ship
        - services[] (String[]): the services offered on the ship
        - cruiseType (String): the type of cruise the ship
      
    Processing: 
        - CruiseShip(): overloaded default constructor
        - CruiseShip(args): overloaded initialization constructor
        - Setters and Getters for all variables
        - print(): overloaded to print the cruise ship's additional information, then calls Ship's print()

    Printing:
        - print(): overloaded to print the cruise ship's additional information, then calls Ship's print()

ShipTestDriver class:

    Description:
        Driver class to test the Ship, CargoShip, and CruiseShip classes. 
        Populates an array with a combination of Ship, CargoShip, and CruiseShip objects. 
        Demonstrates polymorphic behavior of the classes by calling print() on each object in the array.

    Variables:
        - NUM_SHIPS (static final int): the number ships to create
        - shipArray (Ship[]): the array of Ship objects to populate

    Processing:
        - main(): populates ship properties
        - calls print() on each object in the array

    Printing:
        - print(): calls print() on each object to demonstrate polymorphic behavior
